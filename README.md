We optimize for the sensor locations in a cylindrical pipe symmetry in a step towards self-supervision of the sensors.
Given the pipe dimensions and the raw signal data, we determine the signal locations using Fourier Transformations.
The group velocity of the acoustic wave in a steel pipe is optimized, for better identification of the material.
In addition also the time delay of the sensor is idenfied.
We follow a Jupyter Notebook structure for simplicity, where one may skip to the end to look at the necessary parameters. 
However, the figures, and outputs of the cells aid in understanding of the setup.
The dataset that the model is trained on is not available due to privacy restrictions and belongs to the University of Helsinki.
